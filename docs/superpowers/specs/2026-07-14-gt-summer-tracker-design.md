# GT Summer Tracker — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-07-14
**Status:** Approved pending user review

## Summary

A public website for Georgia Tech baseball fans that tracks every player expected on the 2027 GT roster through their 2026 collegiate summer league season. The centerpiece is a Baseball Savant-style player profile: season stats, per-game logs, and percentile sliders showing how the player ranks **within their own summer league**. Data refreshes automatically every night from official league statistics sources.

This supersedes the earlier plan whose deliverable was a CSV; the scraping strategy from that plan (player → team → league → official stats source) carries forward as the data pipeline.

## Goals

- One profile page per tracked player: headshot, season stats, league percentile sliders, game log.
- Percentiles computed against all players in that player's league, clearly labeled as such.
- Roster dashboard listing all tracked players with sortable stats.
- League summary page showing where GT players are spread across leagues.
- Fully automatic nightly refresh; zero manual work during the season.
- Repeatable for future summers (new leagues = new config, mostly).

## Non-goals (v1)

Explicitly discussed and deferred or declined:

- Trend/rolling charts over time (declined for v1; nightly history snapshots are stored anyway so this can be added later).
- GT-only leaderboards (declined for v1).
- "Hot right now" featured strip on the home page (declined with home layout Option A).
- Qualified-player percentile thresholds (user chose all-players comparison pool).
- Auth, comments, or any user accounts.

## Decisions log

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Audience | Public — GT fan community |
| Refresh cadence | Automatic nightly (GitHub Actions cron, ~4am ET) |
| Percentile pool | **Everyone in the league** with any stats (no PA/IP qualifier); sample-size context shown via PA/IP on profiles |
| V1 pages | Roster dashboard `/`, player profiles `/players/[slug]`, league summary `/leagues` |
| Architecture | Static site rebuilt nightly (Option A) — Python pipeline → JSON in repo → Astro build → Vercel |
| Frontend | Astro, light theme, GT navy `#003057` / tech gold `#B3A369` |
| Profile layout | Split two-column (mockup Option B, refined v2) |
| Season stats block | Hybrid: rate-stat grid + counting-stat dotted list (mockup v4) |
| Hitter sliders | OPS, AVG, OBP, SLG, K%, BB% |
| Pitcher sliders | ERA, WHIP, K%, BB%, HR/9, OPP AVG |
| Home page | Sortable roster table with Hitters/Pitchers tabs (mockup Option A) |

Mockups referenced above are preserved in `.superpowers/brainstorm/40018-1784064440/content/` (not committed; visual reference only).

## Site design

### Page: Roster dashboard `/`

- Nav bar: "GT SUMMER TRACKER" wordmark (navy bar, gold accent), links: Players, Leagues, About (About can be a footer blurb in v1).
- Tabs: **Hitters | Pitchers**. Filter chip: league (All Leagues ▾). Optional filter: GT status.
- One sortable table (FanGraphs-density). Columns:
  - Hitters: headshot, Player, Team · League, G, AB, AVG, OBP, SLG, OPS, HR, RBI, SB, OPS percentile chip.
  - Pitchers: headshot, Player, Team · League, G, GS, IP, ERA, WHIP, K, BB, SV, ERA percentile chip.
- Percentile chips use the slider color scale (blue→gray→red).
- Rows link to player profiles.
- Below the table: a quiet section listing players with `unassigned` or `not_playing` summer status so nobody silently disappears.
- Table sorting/filtering is the site's one JavaScript island; everything else is static HTML.

### Page: Player profile `/players/[slug]`

Approved layout (mockup `profile-layout-v2` + stats block `v4-hybrid`):

1. **Hero header** — navy gradient, gold top accent line. Left: circular headshot with gold ring. Center: name, position · GT status (small caps gold), team name, league as a gold pill badge. Right: season context (e.g., "2026 Summer · 32 G · 118 AB" / IP for pitchers).
2. **League context strip** — light gray band: "ⓘ Percentiles rank {first name} against all {League} {hitters|pitchers}, 2026 season · updated nightly". This plus the header badge plus the percentile section title are the three reinforcing signals of the comparison pool.
3. **Two-column body** (stacks on mobile):
   - Left — **Season Stats**: rate-stat grid of 4 cells (hitters: AVG, OBP, SLG, OPS with OPS highlighted navy/gold; pitchers: ERA highlighted, WHIP, K/9, BB/9), then counting stats as a two-column dotted-leader list (hitters: Games, Hits, Doubles, Triples, HR, RBI | At Bats, Runs, Walks, Strikeouts, HBP, SB/CS combined; pitchers: G, GS, IP, W–L, SV, HLD if available | H, R, ER, BB, K, HB, HR allowed).
   - Right — **{League} Percentiles**: six Savant-style sliders. Each row: metric label, track with gradient fill, percentile bubble (colored, white ring), value at right, and a subtle gray tick on the track with a tiny label beneath marking the league average (e.g., "lg avg .742").
4. **Game log** — full-width table, newest first. Hitters: Date, Opponent, AB, R, H, 2B, 3B, HR, RBI, BB, K, SB. Pitchers: Date, Opponent, IP, H, R, ER, BB, K, HR, W/L/SV decision.

Two-way players get both hitting and pitching blocks stacked.

### Page: League summary `/leagues`

One card per league with GT players: league name + logo-free wordmark, official site link, count of GT players, and the list of those players (headshot thumbnails, linked to profiles). Sorted by player count descending.

### Visual language

- Light theme. Navy `#003057` (headers, emphasis), gold `#B3A369` (accents, badges, section underlines), background `#f6f7f9`, cards white with soft shadows.
- Percentile color scale: continuous blue `#4a7de0` (0th) → gray → red `#d93025` (100th), always oriented so red = good. Same scale for sliders, chips, and any future use.
- Headshots everywhere a player is named: hero (72px), table rows (22px), league cards.

### Player registry (`players.yaml`)

Hand-curated by design: discovering a player's summer team is research (roster announcements, team sites), not nightly automation. Schema per player:

```yaml
- name: Jackson Blakely
  slug: jackson-blakely
  gt_status: returning          # returning | transfer | freshman
  position: RHP
  player_type: pitcher          # hitter | pitcher | two_way
  summer:
    status: assigned            # assigned | unassigned | not_playing
    team: Willmar Stingers
    league: northwoods          # key into leagues.yaml
    stats_id: "12345"           # player id/URL slug on the league stats platform
  photo: headshots/jackson-blakely.jpg
```

Known assignments at spec time (verified in prior research): Jackson Blakely, Jamie Vicens, Riley Hasenstab → Willmar Stingers (Northwoods League); Caden Spivey → Trenton Thunder (MLB Draft League). All other tracked players start `unassigned` pending the research pass (see Bootstrap).

Excluded entirely (drafted/signed or transferred out per the original plan): Brosius, Patel, Lackey, Burress, Advincula, Kerce, McKee (likely), Neises, Brown, Dee, Stephenson, Wilcox.

### Scrapers

- One module per **stats platform**; a league is a config entry (platform + base URL + season id). Adding a league on a known platform costs a YAML block, not code.
- Interface: `fetch_league_stats(league_cfg) -> LeagueStats` (full batting + pitching tables for every player in the league) and `fetch_game_log(league_cfg, player) -> list[GameLine]`.
- Prefer JSON/API endpoints discovered via network inspection; fall back to HTML parsing (BeautifulSoup/lxml); Playwright only if a platform is JS-only.
- Polite scraping: single session per league, retries with backoff, ~1 req/sec throttle, honest User-Agent. Nightly volume is small (~20 league-table requests + ~40 game-log requests across all leagues).

### League coverage tiers

Full league tables are NOT assumed to be accessible for every league. Each league is assigned a tier during bootstrap, and the site degrades gracefully:

- **Tier 1 — full league tables retrievable** (expected for the major platforms: Pointstreak, PrestoSports, MLB-affiliated): complete experience — stats, game logs, percentile sliders with league-average ticks.
- **Tier 2 — player stats retrievable, full league tables not practical** (login-gated GameChanger leagues, leaders-only views): profile shows season stats and game log; the sliders section is replaced by a quiet note — "{League} does not publish full league statistics, so percentiles aren't available." Dashboard percentile chip shows "—".
- **Tier 3 — no machine-readable stats**: player appears with team/league and a link to the official site; stats marked unavailable.

Percentiles are computed only for Tier 1 leagues; the UI never shows a percentile built from a partial pool.

### Percentile engine

- **Pool:** all players in the league with nonzero PA (hitters) / nonzero IP or BF (pitchers). No qualification threshold (user decision).
- **Rank:** midrank percentile — percent of pool strictly below the value plus half the ties — rounded to integer 0–99.
- **Orientation:** always higher-percentile = better. Metrics where lower raw value is better (hitter K%; pitcher ERA, WHIP, BB%, HR/9, OPP AVG) are rank-inverted before display.
- **League average (tick mark):** computed from league aggregate totals (e.g., league OPS from summed league counting stats), not the mean of individual player rates.
- **Derived inputs** when a platform's tables omit them: PA ≈ AB + BB + HBP + SF + SH; BF ≈ 3·IP + H + BB (+ HBP if available); hitter K% = K/PA, BB% = BB/PA; pitcher K% = K/BF, BB% = BB/BF; HR/9 = 9·HR/IP; OPP AVG preferred from platform, else H / (BF − BB − HBP − estimated sacrifices). Derivations are flagged in the data (`derived: true`) for transparency.

### Data model (pipeline output)

- `site/src/data/players.json` — array of player records:

```jsonc
{
  "slug": "ryan-zuckerman",
  "name": "Ryan Zuckerman",
  "gtStatus": "returning",
  "position": "INF",
  "playerType": "hitter",
  "summer": { "status": "assigned", "team": "...", "leagueKey": "coastal_plain" },
  "photo": "/headshots/ryan-zuckerman.jpg",
  "asOf": "2026-07-14",                  // per-player staleness stamp
  "hitting": {
    "counting": { "g": 32, "ab": 118, "r": 27, "h": 35, "d": 8, "t": 1, "hr": 6,
                   "rbi": 24, "bb": 15, "k": 28, "hbp": 4, "sb": 9, "cs": 2 },
    "rates":    { "avg": 0.298, "obp": 0.371, "slg": 0.541, "ops": 0.912,
                   "kPct": 0.24, "bbPct": 0.11 },
    "sliders": [ { "metric": "ops", "value": 0.912, "percentile": 87,
                    "leagueAvg": 0.742, "derived": false }, ... ]
  }
}
```

- `site/src/data/gamelogs/{slug}.json` — per-player game array.
- `site/src/data/leagues.json` — per league: key, name, abbrev, officialUrl, platform, tier, gtPlayers[]. (League averages are NOT duplicated here — the per-metric `leagueAvg` each profile needs ships inside that player's `sliders`; decision recorded during Task 8 review.)
- `data/history/YYYY-MM-DD/` — copy of the three outputs above per night.

### Nightly workflow (`.github/workflows/nightly.yml`)

1. Cron ~08:00 UTC (4am ET; all leagues' games long finished).
2. `python pipeline/build_data.py` — scrape leagues independently → compute percentiles → validate → write JSON + history snapshot.
3. Commit data changes; push. Vercel builds and deploys the Astro site on push. **Workflow-authoring note (from Task 9 review):** `build_data.py` exits 1 on a partial failure even though it wrote carried-forward outputs first — the commit/push step must run regardless of that exit code (`if: always()` or equivalent), otherwise one broken league would block deploying every healthy league's fresh data.
4. Also triggerable manually (`workflow_dispatch`) for on-demand refresh.

## Error handling & data quality

- **Per-league isolation:** each league scrapes in its own try/except. A failure logs loudly, keeps that league's previous JSON (players keep their `asOf` stamp, profiles show "updated {date}"), and never blocks other leagues or the deploy.
- **Validation gate before publish (`validate.py`):** rates within sane bounds (0 ≤ AVG/OBP ≤ 1, ERA ≥ 0), league tables non-empty, counting stats never decrease vs. yesterday for the same player, every assigned player found in their league table. Violation ⇒ that league falls back to previous data and the run is marked failed-partial in the Actions log.
- **Missing player:** an assigned player absent from league tables (roster cut, name mismatch) surfaces in the log summary rather than 404ing — profile renders with "no stats recorded yet".
- **Unassigned players:** rendered in the dashboard's "No summer assignment yet" section; profile shows status instead of empty stats.

## Testing

- **Scrapers:** pytest against committed fixture files (real captured pages per platform); no live HTTP in tests. One live smoke-test script run manually when onboarding a league.
- **Percentile engine:** unit tests with small hand-computed distributions, including tie handling, inverted metrics, and derived PA/BF paths.
- **Validation gate:** unit tests for each rule.
- **Site:** Astro build in CI on every push (broken data ⇒ failed build ⇒ no deploy); component-level snapshot of PercentileSlider math (percent → position/color).

## Handoff conditions (recorded during Plan 1 final review)

1. **Sample data must never deploy publicly unflagged.** The committed northwoods data is fabricated sample data attributed to three real players (Blakely, Vicens, Hasenstab). Plan 2's site must treat `platform == "fixture"` in leagues.json as "show a 'sample data — not live stats' disclaimer," and the public launch is gated on Plan 3's real scraper replacing the fixture source. Consider adding an explicit `source`/`provisional` field to players.json.
2. **Fixture→real cutover needs a one-time reset.** The first real scrape will be validated against the committed fabricated `previous` — real counting stats lower than invented ones would trip the decrease check and lock the league on stale sample data via carry-forward. At cutover, delete the committed sample `site/src/data` contents (and optionally the sample history snapshots) before the first real run.
3. **Real scrapers (Plan 3): skip gamelog writes when a present player's log fetch returns empty** — an empty fetch currently overwrites a good log file; only omitted players are protected.

## Bootstrap (pre-launch research, not code)

1. Research pass over all tracked players: find summer team via roster announcements/team sites; fill `players.yaml`; flag unverifiable players for user confirmation.
2. Identify each league's stats platform; verify whether full batting/pitching tables are actually retrievable and assign the league a coverage tier (see League coverage tiers); capture fixture pages; note JSON endpoints.
3. Fetch headshots: GT roster page for returning players; previous school/team sites for transfers and freshmen; store locally in `site/public/headshots/` (a generic silhouette placeholder for anyone missing).
4. Seed `leagues.yaml` for every league that has ≥1 GT player.
